# Smart-Home-System-interfacing
A smart home system designed on Proteus 8 pro and coded on MPLAP X IDE for PIC18F46K20 microcontrollers

The following system was designed as a finale project for the MCU Interfacing phase in an Embedded systems deploma made by Eng. Ahmed abd-El Ghafar El kenany 
with the addition of the smart gate and lighting system from my personal research purposes.

The system is divided into 4 main sections:
  * I2C Bus Network.
  * Temperature regulation system.
  * Smart Gate system.
  * Automatic lighting control system.
with the added addition of an LCD unit to display the current date, time and temperature data read by the MCUs.
